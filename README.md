TinyTown is a small text-based discord bot that lets you build a cute village. Gather resources like wood and stone, and build parks, museums and other buildings! 
Additionally, TinyTown provides an easy-to-understand leveling system. Finally, we have a command that gives you random words of praise and affirmations.
